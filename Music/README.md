## Helio - Compose Music in Style

`Helio` is a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) that can be used for composing and arranging music.

It can be used with synthesizers like `helm` to create entire songs, from drum beats, to basslines, to melodies.

Helio can also be used to render to midi, flac, wav, and edit and quantize notes entered.

## Helm - In Linux Synth

Helm has many instruments, and one can add them one by one to Helio (one track is allowed per instrument).
