# How to set up your desktop


Before we'll start, open a terminal and a firefox.

We'll try these three, then select your fav.

## 50-50 mode

Open one browser, and open one terminal.
Have them be side by side with 50% each.

Great for working with firefox:

`(windows-key) + (left-arrow)` - move to the left 50%
`(windows-key) + (right-arrow)` - move window to right 50%

## Single Desktop, Multiple fullscreen windows

For more space for each window, could try switching between them:
`alt + tab` - switch between this window and last window (best with only two windows open)

## Multiworkspace Windows

Creates large space for each window, with means for switching.

To do this:

`ctrl + alt + (left-arrow)` - move one workspace to the left
`ctrl + alt + (right-arrow)` - move one workspace to the right

To bring your window with you, also hold shift:
`shift + ctrl + alt + (left-arrow)` - bring window and move one workspace to the left
`shift + ctrl + alt + (right-arrow)` - bring window and move one workspace to the right
